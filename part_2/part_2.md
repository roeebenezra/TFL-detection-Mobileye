How to start:
Set up a Pythonic environment. Install the necessary packages from the provided requirements.txt file using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Familiarize yourself with these important Python packages:

PyTorch: An open-source library developed for the purpose of implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning neural networks. It is known for its flexibility and efficiency in handling and processing large datasets with GPU acceleration.

Milestones:

--- important ---
This exercise focuses on the iterative nature of neural network development, emphasizing the cycle of training, testing, and refining your model to optimize performance.

PyTorch Intro:
Start with a deep dive into PyTorch, the library you'll be using to create your Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Explore its documentation, tutorials, and the critical functions you'll use in your task. Understand how to use and manipulate tensors in PyTorch, and learn how various operations are applied to them.

Run Me:
Run the provided code. Observe the output, and familiarize yourself with the key stages of the network's operation. There's no need for debugging at this stage; focus on understanding the flow of the code.

Step into the Code:
Delve into the provided codebase. Understand the architecture of the CNN model, the layers used, and how data is fed into the model. Get a grasp on the forward pass, backpropagation, and how the weights of the model are updated.

Try to Overfit the Network on a small Train Set:
Make an intentional effort to overfit your model on training data. This ensures the model has enough capacity (complexity) to learn from the data. You can do this by training on a *small* subset of the data and aiming for zero loss.

Achieve Low Loss on Full Test Set:
Next, confirm the model's generalization ability on the full test dataset. Run the model on this dataset and aim for a low loss. Fine-tune the model, adjust parameters, and consider applying regularization techniques or other strategies to achieve this. Your goal here is to ensure your model performs well on unseen data, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Full Presentation:
Prepare a clear and concise presentation of your work. Explain the modifications you made to the model, their impact on its performance, and compare the final model with the other models you developed during your experimentation. Highlight the differences in architecture, parameters, and results between your models.

Remember, the key to success in this task is through iteration and experimentation. You might not get the best results in your first attempt, but each experiment brings you closer to the optimal solution. Happy coding!
